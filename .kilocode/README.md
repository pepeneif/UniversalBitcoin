## üîß How to Use

### For New Developers
1. **Start with [`MEMORY-MAP.md`](rules/MEMORY-MAP.md)** - Understand the mental models and cognitive framework
2. **Review [`CODE-CONVENTIONS.md`](rules/CODE-CONVENTIONS.md)** - Learn coding standards and style requirements
3. **Study [`SECURITY-GUIDELINES.md`](rules/SECURITY-GUIDELINES.md)** - Understand security requirements (mandatory)
4. **Follow [`DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md`](workflows/DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md)** - Learn the development process

### For Feature Development
1. **Architecture Phase**: Review [`MEMORY-MAP.md`](rules/MEMORY-MAP.md) for decision frameworks
2. **Implementation Phase**: Follow [`CODE-CONVENTIONS.md`](rules/CODE-CONVENTIONS.md) standards
3. **Security Phase**: Validate against [`SECURITY-GUIDELINES.md`](rules/SECURITY-GUIDELINES.md)
4. **Testing Phase**: Apply [`TESTING-STRATEGY.md`](rules/TESTING-STRATEGY.md) approaches
5. **Deployment Phase**: Use [`DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`](rules/DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md) procedures

### For Code Reviews
- Use [`CODE-REVIEW-PROCESS.md`](workflows/CODE-REVIEW-PROCESS.md) as checklist
- Validate security compliance with [`SECURITY-GUIDELINES.md`](rules/SECURITY-GUIDELINES.md)
- Ensure code follows [`CODE-CONVENTIONS.md`](rules/CODE-CONVENTIONS.md) standards

## üß† Core Principles

### 1. **Security First**
Every decision must prioritize security, especially with Guardian Angels multi-sig operations and Bitcoin key management.

### 2. **Transparency by Design**
All operations must be auditable and verifiable by the public. No black boxes.

### 3. **Scalability Mindset**
Design for growth across multiple blockchains and high transaction volumes.

### 4. **Reliability Priority**
Financial systems require 99.9%+ uptime. Build for resilience.

## üìã Compliance Requirements

### Mandatory Reading
- [ ] [`MEMORY-MAP.md`](rules/MEMORY-MAP.md) - Mental models and decision frameworks
- [ ] [`SECURITY-GUIDELINES.md`](rules/SECURITY-GUIDELINES.md) - Security requirements (non-negotiable)
- [ ] [`CODE-CONVENTIONS.md`](rules/CODE-CONVENTIONS.md) - Coding standards

### Before First Commit
- [ ] Understand Guardian Angels security model
- [ ] Know Bitcoin message signing requirements
- [ ] Familiar with multi-chain architecture patterns
